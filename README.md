# How To Run This Script

1. Go to the chapter that you want to extract word count from.
2. Copy and paste the script (wc.js or wc-minified.js) into the browser's console and hit **Enter**. Note that the script will be erased when you refresh or re-open the page. You may import this script using Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey (it will load the script automatically when the page is open.)
* [Greasemonkey (Firefox)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)
* [Tampermonkey (Chrome/Edge)](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en)
3. An icon with the text "WC" will appear at the top.
